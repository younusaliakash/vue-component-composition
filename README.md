# Vue.js Component Composition Practice Project

Dive into the world of Vue.js component composition with our interactive practice project! This project provides hands-on experience with passing data from parent to child components using props. Additionally, it demonstrates how events triggered from child components can be effectively handled and functionalized in the parent component.

## Project Highlights:

- **Component Composition Mastery:** Learn the art of composing Vue.js components, understanding the seamless flow of data from parent components to child components.

- **Props Implementation:** Explore the concept of props, where data is sent from parent components to child components, enabling efficient communication and reusability of code.

- **Event Handling and Functionalization:** Witness the power of Vue.js as events triggered from child components are captured and functionalized in the parent component, showcasing the flexibility and interactivity of Vue.js applications.

## Key Learning Objectives:

1. **Understanding Props:** Grasp the fundamentals of props in Vue.js, gaining proficiency in passing data and properties from parent components to child components.

2. **Event Triggering and Handling:** Learn how to trigger events from child components and handle them in the parent component, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of your Vue.js applications.

## How to Engage:

1. **Explore Component Composition:** Interact with the project components to understand how data flows seamlessly between parent and child components, enabling effective communication and collaboration.

2. **Experiment with Props:** Experiment with different data values sent via props, observing how child components dynamically respond to changes, showcasing the power of component composition.

3. **Trigger and Handle Events:** Trigger events from the child components and observe how these events are captured and functionalized in the parent component, demonstrating real-time interactivity.
